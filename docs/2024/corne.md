# Corne

I've been using a Preonic layout (5x12 ortholinear layout) for the past 2~3 years and it has been an amazing transition from a regular keyboard. But lately, my back, shoulders, and wrists have been killing me. So this time around, I'll be building a wireless Corne - a 42 key split keyboard.

## The PCB

### Available options

From my previous handwired builds, I learned that handwiring is very time consuming. I knew I wanted to use a PCB this time around - possibly even have it made by a vendor like JLCPCB. There were a lot of variants of Corne that each had different characteristics. I have previously used a 5 column split keyboard like the [Charybdis Nano](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Charybdis) (3x5+3) and I learned I needed a 6th column for `ESC`, `TAB`, `SHIFT`, and `ENTER`.

### The decision

I decided I would use the [cho-corne-ice](https://github.com/e3b0c442/crkbd/tree/cho-corne-ice) by [e3b0c442](https://github.com/e3b0c442). It had a sleek design with the reset button on the side and a small power switch below that would situate below the USB-C port. The build guide and required parts were very well documented to be easily reproducible. All the parts were also readily available on Aliexpress.
